## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI report offers data-driven insights into customer churn, including:

- **Total Customers:** 7,000  
- **Churned Customers:** 2,000  
- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.5%

### Key Insights:
- **Contract Type:**
  - Month-to-month customers have the highest churn rate (≈3.9K).
  - Long-term contract holders (1–2 year terms) show significantly lower churn.
  
- **Payment Method:**
  - Electronic check users have the highest churn rate (~2.4K).
  - Mailed check users also show moderate churn (~1.6K).
  
- **Internet Service Type:**
  - Fiber optic users account for the largest portion of churned customers (~3.1K).
  - DSL and non-internet users show lower churn.

- **Tenure:**
  - Churn is concentrated among users with 0–1 year and over 4 years of service.
  - Tenure appears to play a dual role: both new and long-standing customers are at risk.

- **Monthly Charges:**
  - Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn, especially in shorter tenure groups.
